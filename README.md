# Coding Tutor AI

## Description
A Command-Line-Interface generative AI Coding Tutor that will answer coding questions prompted by the user. This was developed by following EdX's course titled "AI Applications and Prompt Engineering" which can be found [here](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-programming/edx-ai-applications-and-prompt-engineering). That is to say, this was entirely built just by following the course. 

## Installation
Clone or fork the project into a desired location on your local computer. 

## Usage
- The latest LTS version of node.js must be installed. 
  - We recommend installing [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to switch between node.js versions if your projects call for different versions. 
- Install all dependencies by running `npm i` in the terminal from the root folder of the project.
- Run the program by typing in `node script.js`
